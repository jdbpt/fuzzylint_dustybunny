2022 GDEX game jam occured over 9 days.  
Participated in the 2022 GDEX Game Jam as a solo game developer participant. The game jam theme was "Erase". Related to that theme, from conception to execution I designed and programmed a fast paced, family-friendly game for PC about a hopping piece of dryer lint named Lint Fuzzy, who desires to live in Couch Cradle but they will have to prove themselves first. During development, I utilized: Unity Game Engine (C# programming) and Visual Studio, Autodesk Maya, Adobe Photoshop, Audacity (audio), and Google docs and Hack n Plan for game design documentation and tasks. Please see link above to download and play the game for free.
Please see here all game scripts from the game.  Note some scripts are essentially blank because they did not end up having a function. 
Scripts of note are related to Vacuum AI, Fanny Fan function, and UI transitions.
